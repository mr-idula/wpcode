Web Programming Project --> Neighborhood Gems

This repository contains the code as well as pictures of the website I have created for my
Web Programming Course (Spring 2023). 

Neighborhood Gems is a directory of Atlanta's local businesses. Users with access to the login information will be able to 
access this information. There are 4 categories: Lifestyle, Food & Drink, Nightlife, and Clothing. There is also a forum that allows users to comment local businessess they would like to add to the list. 

The course project required a use of a database, a login system, ajax utlization, Javascript, new library usage, and the website had to have a theme that was standard for all pages. 

The timeline for this project was a week. The website was hosted on an Amazon EC2 instance. On the server I installed Apache HTTP Server and PhpMyAdmin. For the database I used PhpMyAdmin to store the login information. All pages in the website have the same lavender background, light blue cards, and the same nav bar. The Forum page utilizes ajax. For the new library usage requirement, I utilized Google Maps API to provide a visual for the locations of each local business and in order to place markers on the google map and add locations to it I wrote functions in Javascript. 

This is the inital development of this website, improvements such as working on the forum page, adding security measures, and working on the login system to allow users to register a new membership.
